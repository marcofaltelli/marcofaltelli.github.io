I am a Researcher in the <a href="https://www.enea.it/en/">ENEA</a> High Performance Computing Lab.

In June 2023 I obtained my PhD in Computer Science under the supervision of <a href="http://netgroup.uniroma2.it/people/faculties/giuseppebianchi/">Prof. Giuseppe Bianchi</a> and <a href="https://francescoquaglia.github.io/">Prof. Francesco Quaglia</a>.\\
My research activities combine computer networking and computer architecture to design high performing, scalable architectures for both network hardware and software solutions.

My research has been awarded with a <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/academic-program/phd-fellowship/">Microsoft Research PhD Fellowship</a>. I've been a Research Intern at <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-cambridge/">Microsoft Research Cambridge</a> under the supervision of <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/serleg/">Sergey Legtchenko</a> during Summer 2022 .

In the past, I collaborated with <a href="https://www.cnit.it/">CNIT</a> on the <a href="https://www.5g-picture-project.eu/">5G-PICTURE</a> European project.

I further collaborate with <a href="https://axbryd.com/">Axbryd</a>, a startup company founded from the <a href="http://netprog.uniroma2.it/">NetProg</a> group of the University of Rome "Tor Vergata".

I am always looking for collaboration and feedbacks. If your research interests are close to mine, feel free to reach out!
